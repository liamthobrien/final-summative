Week 1 – Setup & Data Cleaning

Goals:

Set up GitHub repo and virtual environment

Load and inspect dataset

Clean and preprocess data

Tasks & Responsibilities:

Person A:

Verify dataset, standardize country names, handle missing data

Generate lagged features (year t → t+1)

Create processed_wheat_yield.csv

Person B:

Explore dataset: summary statistics, outliers, trends

Start plotting initial yield trends per country

Everyone:

Meet to agree on project structure and file naming

Ensure everyone can pull/push to repo

Deliverables by end of Week 1:

data/raw_wheat_yield.csv & processed_wheat_yield.csv

Notebook: 01_data_cleaning.ipynb

Initial GitHub commit


Week 2 – Analysis & Modeling

Goals:

Explore correlations and relationships between countries

Build predictive models

Tasks & Responsibilities:

Person B:

Correlation matrix between countries

Heatmaps and visualizations for trends

Lagged correlation analysis (effect of major producers on other countries next year)

Person C:

Build predictive models: linear regression, multiple regression

Evaluate model performance (cross-validation, R², RMSE)

Identify most influential major producer countries

Person A:

Support modeling with additional preprocessing if needed

Check dataset consistency

Person D:

Document analysis steps in notebook

Ensure plots are labeled and interpretable

Deliverables by end of Week 2:

Notebook: 02_exploratory_analysis.ipynb and 03_modeling.ipynb

Visualizations and correlation analysis

Preliminary conclusions for discussion


Week 3 – Interactive App & Final Submission

Goals:

Build interactive app for visualization

Finalize README, requirements, and submission package

QA & final testing

Tasks & Responsibilities:

Person D:

Build PyShiny / Streamlit app

Allow user to select countries and see yield trends/predictions

Integrate visualizations from Week 2

Everyone:

Test notebooks and app for reproducibility

Review narrative explanations in notebooks

Refine conclusions, limitations, and future work section in README
